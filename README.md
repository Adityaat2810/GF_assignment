# ImageQuest: Performance Optimization and Scalability

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. State Management Refinement
- Use lazy loading and code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- Leverage Vue's `computed` properties and `watch` for reactive, performant updates

### 2. API and Network Optimization
- Add request debouncing and throttling to minimize unnecessary API calls
- Implement client-side caching using `localStorage` or in-memory caching
- Create robust error handling with automatic retry mechanisms for network requests

### 3. Image Loading Techniques
- Implement progressive image loading with low-resolution placeholders
- Use `IntersectionObserver` for efficient lazy loading of images
- Add WebP and next-gen image format support for faster load times

### 4. Scalable Frontend Architecture
- Break down monolithic components into smaller, reusable Vue components
- Implement TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience


### 6. Optimization Techniques
- Use `v-once` and `keep-alive` for static or infrequently changing components
- Implement memoization for expensive computations
- Minimize DOM manipulations and optimize render cycles

### 7. Advanced Scaling Considerations
- Consider server-side rendering (SSR) for improved initial load performance
- Implement a backend proxy for API rate limiting and caching
